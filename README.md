## Overview
I create a predictive model to increase donations for a charity by targeting likely repeat donors with a marketing campaign. To reduce costs of the marketing campaign, we want to only target the donors who are most likely to re-donate if we contact them through the marketing campaign.

## Feature Engineering
- Creation of relevant features
- Data cleaning

## Model 1
- Feature scaling for logistic regression
- Base model
- Feature selection based on area increase of ROC curve
- Plot of accuracy of train and test data against number of features selected
- Evaluation of model on test data
- Gain and lift curves

## Model 2
- Manual selection of features with graphical analysis of target feature incidence
- Evaluation of model on test data
